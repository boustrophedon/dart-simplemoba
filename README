This is going to be a simple moba. You can play as "attack", "defense", or "support." 

- Attack is the triangle and shoots short-range missiles that do damage. They have medium health.
- Defense is the circle and can destroy the missiles and have a higher health. Their defense also doubles as a low-damage knockback attack.
- Support is the square and spawns minions. They have the lowest health but are also the most important.
	- Minions heal your team and attack the other team's base. They are destroyed on contact with enemy players.

for now everyone is a square and the colors are different
